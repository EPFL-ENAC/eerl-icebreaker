The **Extreme Environments Research Laboratory** (EERL) aims to create understanding of aerosol processes in polar and mountain environments and therefore performs observations in the field.

This website provides an overview of past campaigns and their scientific purposes. By clicking on a specific campaign, a pop-up window will provide information on the types of measurements and links to papers and data sets.

For questions or access to not-yet-published data sets please contact: [Julia Schmale @ EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/julia.schmale)
